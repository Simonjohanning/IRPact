# Release Notes IRPact v1.0.0
## Intended Audience
The audience for these release notes are modelers interested in using the innovation diffusion framework IRPact, as well as software developers who want to contribute to the development of the software
## Purpose of the Release Notes
As the first release of the software, these release notes are intended to provide some insight (additional to the documentation in the [public repository](https://github.com/Simonjohanning/IRPact).
## License
IRPopt is published under the [GNU General Public License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/quick-guide-gplv3.pdf). This means that you can use the software for any purpose,  share the software with your friends and neighbors, change the software to suit your needs, and share the changes you make.
## Compatibility
The framework should run on any machine that has a decent Java environment setup.
## Recommendations for Use
The framework is designed as an empirical agent-based modeling tool for innovation diffusion of sustainable products. This doesn't mean it can't be used for other contexts, but that is built on assumption derived from literature in this area. If you want to adopt it to another context and research (which we would be delighted about!), you would have to adopt it. Please be in touch for support and to let us know that the tool is used (johanning@wifa.uni-leipzig.de).
## How to Get Started?
If you have Java and Maven installed, you should be able to pull all other dependencies through maven (mvn package) and create the respective jar. All you need to now is to create a configuration (see the [user guide](https://github.com/Simonjohanning/IRPact/tree/master/documentation/userGuide.md) for instructions how to do this) and you should be ready to run the jar (java -jar [name of the file]).
## Updates
Updates on IRPact will be done on an irregular basis and will be announced through the respective channels.
